# HandlebarsBug

## Thanks for Brunch and Such!
First off, thanks for making Brunch and handlebars-brunch. The Brunch tool is pretty awesome and makes working with Phoenix much nicer, as opposed to them having to create something like that from scratch.

## Built With Phoenix

This app is built with [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org) 1.1.4 All the brunch/npm versions are in package.json

## The Issue

When I fire up the app and visit localhost:4000 in the latest Chrome, I get this error: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'Handlebars' of undefined`

## Starting the app

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
